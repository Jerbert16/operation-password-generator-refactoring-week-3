# Operation Password Generator Refraction README

## Project Description:

An employee at a local company has access to sensitive data and needs a tool to help them generate secure passwords. Thus, the purpose of this project is to take the existing starter code and refractor it into an application that allows the user to generate a random password (which can include special characters) based on user-selected criterion. 

To do this, the app will employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and run in the browser of the user. As a result, the user will be equipped to generate passwords that are both random and secure. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
